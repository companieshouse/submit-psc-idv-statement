      </h1>

      <p class="govuk-body-l">Use this service to provide a Companies House personal code for an individual person with significant control (PSC), or relevant officer details for a relevant legal entity (RLE).  
      </p>

      <p class="govuk-body"><strong>You can also use this service to:</strong></p> 
      
      <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
      <li>check when a company's PSCs and RLEs need to provide verification details</li>
      <li>request an extension if you need more time</li>
      </ul>
    
      <p class="govuk-body">You cannot use this service if the PSC has their personal information protected at Companies House (or is waiting for the results of an application)</p>

      <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">When you need to provide verification details</h2>
      
      <p class="govuk-body">You must wait until the company has reached its confirmation statement date before you can provide verification details for its PSCs or RLEs. You will not be able to do it early.</p>
        
      <p class="govuk-body">The deadline for individual PSCs is 14 days after the confirmation statement date, and RLEs have 28 days.</p>

      <p class="govuk-body">You can see the deadline dates for a company's PSCs and RLEs by signing in to this service.</p>

      <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Requesting an extension</h2>
      
      <p class="govuk-body">
        If you cannot provide a PSC or RLE's verification details by the deadline, you can use this service to request an extension. 
        

      <p class="govuk-body">PSCs can request an additional 14 days, and RLEs can request an additional 28 days. You can only request one extension for each PSC or RLE.
        
      <p class="govuk-body">You must wait until the company has reached its confirmation statement date before you can submit a request. You will not be able to request an extension after the PSC or RLE's deadline has passed.
